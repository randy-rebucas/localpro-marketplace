            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
              By registering for or using the LocalPro Marketplace (&ldquo;Platform&rdquo;) at <strong>localpro.asia</strong>,
              you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;). If you do not agree, please do not

            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
              LocalPro is an online marketplace that connects clients who need local services
              (e.g., plumbing, electrical work, cleaning) with service providers who offer those services.
              LocalPro is a platform intermediary only — we are not a party to any service agreement
              between clients and providers, and we do not employ service providers.

              Disputes between clients and providers should first be attempted to be resolved directly through
              the in-app messaging system. If unresolved, either party may raise a formal dispute through the
              Platform&apos;s dispute mechanism. LocalPro admin will review evidence submitted by both parties and
              issue a decision within 5 business days. LocalPro&apos;s decision on escrow allocation is final and
              binding on the platform.
